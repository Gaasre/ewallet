# eWallet App

This is flutter app i made using the flutter framework.

# How it works

The goal is to be able to buy and sell products online. All you need is a phone with a working camera to be able to scan barcodes.

## Steps

1. The buyer/seller should be connected to the app
2. The buyer and the seller have access to their wallet as well as the history of their transactions
3. If you decide to sell a product you'll have to set its price and name. After confirming, the product will be added to pending products. A barcode will be generated so you can share it.
4. The buyer needs to scan the code then pay for it.
5. The seller is notified that his pending product has been sold.
